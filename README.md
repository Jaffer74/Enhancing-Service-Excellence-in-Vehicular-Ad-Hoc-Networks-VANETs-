## üìñ **Introduction**  

Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) play a pivotal role in modern transportation systems by enabling communication between vehicles (V2V) and with roadside infrastructure (V2I).  
This project focuses on enhancing the performance of VANETs by addressing challenges such as:  
- High mobility  
- Network congestion  
- Data reliability  

By improving **Quality-of-Service (QoS)** protocols, this project demonstrates how VANETs can support applications like traffic optimization, passenger safety, and emergency response systems.

## ‚ú® **Features**  

- Comprehensive analysis of VANET QoS protocols.  
- Comparison between AODV, DSDV, and Enhanced AODV (ENAODV).  
- Simulation results demonstrating improved packet delivery ratio, throughput, and reduced end-to-end delay.  
- Real-world applicability in dynamic vehicular environments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Methodology**  

Our research methodology includes:  
1. **QoS Requirements Analysis**: Identifying specific requirements for VANET applications (e.g., ultra-low latency for safety systems).  
2. **Traffic Classification**: Categorizing data based on priority (e.g., emergency messages vs. infotainment).  
3. **Protocol Enhancement**: Developing ENAODV by modifying the AODV protocol for better performance.  
4. **Simulation and Evaluation**: Using NS2 and OpenStreetMap to simulate real-world scenarios and compare performance metrics.

## üìä **Key Findings**  

- **Enhanced AODV (ENAODV)** outperforms traditional AODV and DSDV protocols in terms of:  
  - Higher packet delivery ratio (PDR).  
  - Reduced end-to-end delay.  
  - Increased throughput.  
- The integration of **node identity** and **real-time location data** improves routing efficiency in dynamic traffic conditions.
